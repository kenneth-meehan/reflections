What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git sets up the hidden .git folder for record keeping.
	That's where all metadata about the repository are stored.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	They are two distinct logical locations for files.
	The workling directory lets you keep non-crucial stuff around.
	The staging area is like a launch pad, where you "add" all files needed for the next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	Stage files for one change, then commit. Repeat for more changes.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	When trying out new ideas.
	When collaborating with others.
	When you want to keep a stable version handy.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Diagrams always help visualization. I'm still confused though!
	My output from git log --graph --oneline master coins does not match instructors'.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	All code from both branches get merged. Diagram shows the merger.
	Interesting how git log then shows commits by timestamp.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
